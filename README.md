# Senior Java Developer

My repo made to track my middle-to-senior path in software engineering.

## Factors

- **Quality** - you're expected to have solid solutions, sharing knowledge, etc.;
- **Independence** - you're the person other people seeking out to ask a question;
- **Mentoring other sw engineers**;
- **Leveling the whole team up** (good patterns, PR feedback, indirect mentoring, etc.);
- **Being able to operate strategically and not just tactically** (strategic thinking and visioning; tend to have impact on
  the project health level, engaging on a high level with project managers, product managers, scoping tickets,
  prioritizing work).

I found this points quite solid. They are taken from [Peter's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQEMdSI5o3Y).
